Heart Disease Data Analysis:
This project analyzes a heart disease dataset to find patterns and risk factors related to heart health. Using Python and basic data science techniques, we look at the relationship between a patient's age and cholesterol level, and visualize the trends using linear regression.

Technologies Used:
1. Python
2. NumPy
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Data Visualization
6. Basic Statistical Analysis

Dataset:
The dataset used is heart.csv, downloaded from Kaggle. It contains health information of patients like:
age: Age of the patient
chol: Cholesterol level (mg/dl)
trestbps: Resting blood pressure
cp: Chest pain type
target: Heart disease presence (1 = yes, 0 = no)

What This Project Does:
1. Loads and cleans the dataset
2. Plots a scatter graph of age vs cholesterol
3. Implements linear regression using gradient descent
4. Plots the final fitted regression line
5. Displays the loss (error) after every 100 iterations

Conclusion:
This project is a simple example of how data analysis and basic machine learning can be used to find health-related patterns. It's a good starting point for anyone learning data science or working with health datasets.
